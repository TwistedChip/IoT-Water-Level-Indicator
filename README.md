# IoT-Water-Level-Indicator
This project was done with an ultrasonic sensor and a buzzer to detect water level and alert when the water level reaches a certain value. The ESP32 microcontroller is used for making a web server for data monitoring and data is then logged into a google sheets file using webhook through IFTTT.
